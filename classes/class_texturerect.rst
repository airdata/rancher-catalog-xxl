TextureRect
===========

**Inherits:** :ref:`Control<class_control>` **<** :ref:`CanvasItem<class_canvasitem>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_object>`

**Category:** Core

Brief Description
-----------------

Draws a sprite or a texture inside a User Interface. The texture can tile or not.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_TextureRect_expand:

- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **expand** - If ``true``, the texture scales to fit its bounding rectangle. Default value: ``false``.

  .. _class_TextureRect_stretch_mode:

- :ref:`StretchMode<enum_texturerect_stretchmode>` **stretch_mode** - Controls the texture's behavior when you resize the node's bounding rectangle. Set it to one of the ``STRETCH_*`` constants. See the constants to learn more.

  .. _class_TextureRect_texture:

- :ref:`Texture<class_texture>` **texture** - The node's :ref:`Texture<class_texture>` resource.


Enums
-----

  .. _enum_TextureRect_StretchMode:

enum **StretchMode**

- **STRETCH_SCALE_ON_EXPAND** = **0** --- Scale to fit the node's bounding rectangle, only if ``expand`` is ``true``. Default ``stretch_mode``, for backwards compatibility. Until you set ``expand`` to ``true``, the texture will behave like ``STRETCH_KEEP``.
- **STRETCH_SCALE** = **1** --- Scale to fit the node's bounding rectangle.
- **STRETCH_TILE** = **2** --- Tile inside the node's bounding rectangle.
- **STRETCH_KEEP** = **3** --- The texture keeps its original size and stays in the bounding rectangle's top-left corner.
- **STRETCH_KEEP_CENTERED** = **4** --- The texture keeps its original size and stays centered in the node's bounding rectangle.
- **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT** = **5** --- Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, but maintain the texture's aspect ratio.
- **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED** = **6** --- Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, center it and maintain its aspect ratio.
- **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_COVERED** = **7** --- Scale the texture so that the shorter side fits the bounding rectangle. The other side clips to the node's limits.


Description
-----------

Use TextureRect to draw icons and sprites in your User Interfaces. To create panels and menu boxes, take a look at NinePatchFrame. Its Stretch Mode property controls the texture's scale and placement. It can scale, tile and stay centered inside its bounding rectangle. TextureRect is one of the 5 most common nodes to create game UI.
