OccluderPolygon2D
=================

**Inherits:** :ref:`Resource<class_resource>` **<** :ref:`Reference<class_reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_object>`

**Category:** Core

Brief Description
-----------------

Defines a 2D polygon for LightOccluder2D.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_OccluderPolygon2D_closed:

- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **closed** - If ``true`` closes the polygon. A closed OccluderPolygon2D occludes the light coming from any direction. An opened OccluderPolygon2D occludes the light only at its outline's direction. Default value ``true``.

  .. _class_OccluderPolygon2D_cull_mode:

- :ref:`CullMode<enum_occluderpolygon2d_cullmode>` **cull_mode** - Set the direction of the occlusion culling when not ``CULL_DISABLED``. Default value ``DISABLED``.

  .. _class_OccluderPolygon2D_polygon:

- :ref:`PoolVector2Array<class_poolvector2array>` **polygon** - A :ref:`Vector2<class_vector2>` array with the index for polygon's vertices positions.


Enums
-----

  .. _enum_OccluderPolygon2D_CullMode:

enum **CullMode**

- **CULL_DISABLED** = **0** --- Culling mode for the occlusion. Disabled means no culling. See :ref:`cull_mode<class_OccluderPolygon2D_cull_mode>`.
- **CULL_CLOCKWISE** = **1** --- Culling mode for the occlusion. Sets the culling to be in clockwise direction. See :ref:`cull_mode<class_OccluderPolygon2D_cull_mode>`.
- **CULL_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE** = **2** --- Culling mode for the occlusion. Sets the culling to be in counter clockwise direction. See :ref:`cull_mode<class_OccluderPolygon2D_cull_mode>`.


Description
-----------

Editor facility that helps you draw a 2D polygon used as resource for :ref:`LightOccluder2D<class_lightoccluder2d>`.
