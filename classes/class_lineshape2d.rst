Brief Description
-----------------

Line shape for 2D collisions.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_LineShape2D_d:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **d** - The line's distance from the origin.

  .. _class_LineShape2D_normal:

- :ref:`Vector2<class_vector2>` **normal** - The line's normal.


Description
-----------

Line shape for 2D collisions. It works like a 2D plane and will not allow any body to go to the negative side. Not recommended for rigid bodies, and usually not recommended for static bodies either because it forces checks against it on every frame.
