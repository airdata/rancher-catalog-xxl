ConeTwistJoint
==============

**Inherits:** :ref:`Joint<class_joint>` **<** :ref:`Spatial<class_spatial>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_object>`

**Category:** Core

Brief Description
-----------------

A twist joint between two 3D bodies.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_ConeTwistJoint_bias:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **bias** - The speed with which the swing or twist will take place.

The higher, the faster.

  .. _class_ConeTwistJoint_relaxation:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **relaxation** - Defines, how fast the swing- and twist-speed-difference on both sides gets synced.

  .. _class_ConeTwistJoint_softness:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **softness** - The ease with which the joint starts to twist. If it's too low, it takes more force to start twisting the joint.

  .. _class_ConeTwistJoint_swing_span:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **swing_span** - Swing is rotation from side to side, around the axis perpendicular to the twist axis.

The swing span defines, how much rotation will not get corrected allong the swing axis.

Could be defined as looseness in the ``ConeTwistJoint``.

If below 0.05, this behaviour is locked. Default value: ``PI/4``.

  .. _class_ConeTwistJoint_twist_span:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **twist_span** - Twist is the rotation around the twist axis, this value defined how far the joint can twist.

Twist is locked if below 0.05.


Enums
-----

  .. _enum_ConeTwistJoint_Param:

enum **Param**

- **PARAM_SWING_SPAN** = **0** --- Swing is rotation from side to side, around the axis perpendicular to the twist axis.

The swing span defines, how much rotation will not get corrected allong the swing axis.

Could be defined as looseness in the ``ConeTwistJoint``.

If below 0.05, this behaviour is locked. Default value: ``PI/4``.
- **PARAM_TWIST_SPAN** = **1** --- Twist is the rotation around the twist axis, this value defined how far the joint can twist.

Twist is locked if below 0.05.
- **PARAM_BIAS** = **2** --- The speed with which the swing or twist will take place.

The higher, the faster.
- **PARAM_SOFTNESS** = **3** --- The ease with which the joint starts to twist. If it's too low, it takes more force to start twisting the joint.
- **PARAM_RELAXATION** = **4** --- Defines, how fast the swing- and twist-speed-difference on both sides gets synced.
- **PARAM_MAX** = **5** --- End flag of PARAM\_\* constants, used internally.


Description
-----------

The joint can rotate the bodies across an axis defined by the local x-axes of the :ref:`Joint<class_joint>`.

The twist axis is initiated as the x-axis of the :ref:`Joint<class_joint>`.

Once the Bodies swing, the twist axis is calculated as the middle of the x-axes of the Joint in the local space of the two Bodies.
