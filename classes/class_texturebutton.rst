TextureButton
=============

**Inherits:** :ref:`BaseButton<class_basebutton>` **<** :ref:`Control<class_control>` **<** :ref:`CanvasItem<class_canvasitem>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_object>`

**Category:** Core

Brief Description
-----------------

Texture-based button. Supports Pressed, Hover, Disabled and Focused states.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_TextureButton_expand:

- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **expand** - If ``true`` the texture stretches to the edges of the node's bounding rectangle using the :ref:`stretch_mode<class_TextureButton_stretch_mode>`. If ``false`` the texture will not scale with the node. Default value: ``false``.

  .. _class_TextureButton_stretch_mode:

- :ref:`StretchMode<enum_texturebutton_stretchmode>` **stretch_mode** - Controls the texture's behavior when you resize the node's bounding rectangle, **only if** :ref:`expand<class_TextureButton_expand>` is ``true``. Set it to one of the ``STRETCH_*`` constants. See the constants to learn more.

  .. _class_TextureButton_texture_click_mask:

- :ref:`BitMap<class_bitmap>` **texture_click_mask** - Pure black and white Bitmap image to use for click detection. On the mask, white pixels represent the button's clickable area. Use it to create buttons with curved shapes.

  .. _class_TextureButton_texture_disabled:

- :ref:`Texture<class_texture>` **texture_disabled** - Texture to display when the node is disabled. See :ref:`BaseButton.disabled<class_BaseButton_disabled>`.

  .. _class_TextureButton_texture_focused:

- :ref:`Texture<class_texture>` **texture_focused** - Texture to display when the node has mouse or keyboard focus.

  .. _class_TextureButton_texture_hover:

- :ref:`Texture<class_texture>` **texture_hover** - Texture to display when the mouse hovers the node.

  .. _class_TextureButton_texture_normal:

- :ref:`Texture<class_texture>` **texture_normal** - Texture to display by default, when the node is **not** in the disabled, focused, hover or pressed state.

  .. _class_TextureButton_texture_pressed:

- :ref:`Texture<class_texture>` **texture_pressed** - Texture to display on mouse down over the node, if the node has keyboard focus and the player presses the enter key or if the player presses the :ref:`BaseButton.shortcut<class_BaseButton_shortcut>` key.


Enums
-----

  .. _enum_TextureButton_StretchMode:

enum **StretchMode**

- **STRETCH_SCALE** = **0** --- Scale to fit the node's bounding rectangle.
- **STRETCH_TILE** = **1** --- Tile inside the node's bounding rectangle.
- **STRETCH_KEEP** = **2** --- The texture keeps its original size and stays in the bounding rectangle's top-left corner.
- **STRETCH_KEEP_CENTERED** = **3** --- The texture keeps its original size and stays centered in the node's bounding rectangle.
- **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT** = **4** --- Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, but maintain the texture's aspect ratio.
- **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED** = **5** --- Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, center it, and maintain its aspect ratio.
- **STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_COVERED** = **6** --- Scale the texture so that the shorter side fits the bounding rectangle. The other side clips to the node's limits.


Description
-----------

``TextureButton`` has the same functionality as :ref:`Button<class_button>`, except it uses sprites instead of Godot's :ref:`Theme<class_theme>` resource. It is faster to create, but it doesn't support localization like more complex Controls.

The Normal state's texture is required. Others are optional.
