WorldEnvironment
================

**Inherits:** :ref:`Node<class_node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_object>`

**Category:** Core

Brief Description
-----------------

Default environment properties for the entire scene (post-processing effects, lightning and background settings).

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_WorldEnvironment_environment:

- :ref:`Environment<class_environment>` **environment** - The :ref:`Environment<class_environment>` resource used by this ``WorldEnvironment``, defining the default properties.


Description
-----------

The ``WorldEnvironment`` node is used to configure the default :ref:`Environment<class_environment>` for the scene.

The parameters defined in the ``WorldEnvironment`` can be overridden by an :ref:`Environment<class_environment>` node set on the current :ref:`Camera<class_camera>`. Additionally, only one ``WorldEnvironment`` may be instanced in a given scene at a time.

The ``WorldEnvironment`` allows the user to specify default lighting parameters (e.g. ambient lighting), various post-processing effects (e.g. SSAO, DOF, Tonemapping), and how to draw the background (e.g. solid color, skybox). Usually, these are added in order to improve the realism/color balance of the scene.
