Static body for 2D Physics.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_StaticBody2D_bounce:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **bounce** - The body's bounciness. Values range from ``0`` (no bounce) to ``1`` (full bounciness).

  .. _class_StaticBody2D_constant_angular_velocity:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **constant_angular_velocity** - Constant angular velocity for the body. This does not rotate the body, but affects colliding bodies, as if it were rotating.

  .. _class_StaticBody2D_constant_linear_velocity:

- :ref:`Vector2<class_vector2>` **constant_linear_velocity** - Constant linear velocity for the body. This does not move the body, but affects colliding bodies, as if it were moving.

  .. _class_StaticBody2D_friction:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **friction** - The body's friction. Values range from ``0`` (no friction) to ``1`` (full friction).


Description
-----------

Static body for 2D Physics. A StaticBody2D is a body that is not intended to move. It is ideal for implementing objects in the environment, such as walls or platforms.

Additionally, a constant linear or angular velocity can be set for the static body, which will affect colliding bodies as if it were moving (for example, a conveyor belt).
