=================

**Inherits:** :ref:`AudioEffect<class_audioeffect>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_resource>` **<** :ref:`Reference<class_reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_object>`

**Category:** Core

Brief Description
-----------------

Adds a Reverb audio effect to an Audio bus.

Simulates the sound of acoustic environments such as rooms, concert halls, caverns, or an open spaces.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_AudioEffectReverb_damping:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **damping** - Widens or narrows the stereo image of the reverb tail. 1 means fully widens. Value can range from 0 to 1. Default value: ``1``.

  .. _class_AudioEffectReverb_dry:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **dry** - Output percent of original sound. At 0, only modified sound is outputted. Value can range from 0 to 1. Default value: ``1``.

  .. _class_AudioEffectReverb_hipass:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **hipass** - High-pass filter passes signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency. Value can range from 0 to 1. Default value: ``0``.

  .. _class_AudioEffectReverb_predelay_feedback:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **predelay_feedback** - Output percent of predelay. Value can range from 0 to 1. Default value: ``1``.

  .. _class_AudioEffectReverb_predelay_msec:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **predelay_msec** - Time between the original signal and the early reflections of the reverb signal. Default value: ``150ms``.

  .. _class_AudioEffectReverb_room_size:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **room_size** - Dimensions of simulated room. Bigger means more echoes. Value can range from 0 to 1. Default value: ``0.8``.

  .. _class_AudioEffectReverb_spread:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **spread** - Defines how reflective the imaginary room's walls are. Value can range from 0 to 1. Default value: ``1``.

  .. _class_AudioEffectReverb_wet:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **wet** - Output percent of modified sound. At 0, only original sound is outputted. Value can range from 0 to 1. Default value: ``0.5``.


Description
-----------

Simulates rooms of different sizes. Its parameters can be adjusted to simulate the sound of a specific room.
