CollisionShape2D
================

**Inherits:** :ref:`Node2D<class_node2d>` **<** :ref:`CanvasItem<class_canvasitem>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_object>`

**Category:** Core

Brief Description
-----------------

Node that represents collision shape data in 2D space.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_CollisionShape2D_disabled:

- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **disabled** - A disabled collision shape has no effect in the world.

  .. _class_CollisionShape2D_one_way_collision:

- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **one_way_collision** - Sets whether this collision shape should only detect collision on one side (top or bottom).

  .. _class_CollisionShape2D_shape:

- :ref:`Shape2D<class_shape2d>` **shape** - The actual shape owned by this collision shape.


Description
-----------

Editor facility for creating and editing collision shapes in 2D space. You can use this node to represent all sorts of collision shapes, for example, add this to an :ref:`Area2D<class_area2d>` to give it a detection shape, or add it to a :ref:`PhysicsBody2D<class_physicsbody2d>` to create a solid object. **IMPORTANT**: this is an Editor-only helper to create shapes, use :ref:`get_shape<class_CollisionShape2D_get_shape>` to get the actual shape.
