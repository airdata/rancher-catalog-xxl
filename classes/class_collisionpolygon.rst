Brief Description
-----------------

Editor-only class for defining a collision polygon in 3D space.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_CollisionPolygon_depth:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **depth** - Length that the resulting collision extends in either direction perpendicular to its polygon.

  .. _class_CollisionPolygon_disabled:

- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **disabled** - If true, no collision will be produced.

  .. _class_CollisionPolygon_polygon:

- :ref:`PoolVector2Array<class_poolvector2array>` **polygon** - Array of vertices which define the polygon.


Description
-----------

Allows editing a collision polygon's vertices on a selected plane. Can also set a depth perpendicular to that plane. This class is only available in the editor. It will not appear in the scene tree at runtime. Creates a :ref:`Shape<class_shape>` for gameplay. Properties modified during gameplay will have no effect.
