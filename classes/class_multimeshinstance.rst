Brief Description
-----------------

Node that instances a :ref:`MultiMesh<class_multimesh>`.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_MultiMeshInstance_multimesh:

- :ref:`MultiMesh<class_multimesh>` **multimesh** - The :ref:`MultiMesh<class_multimesh>` resource that will be used and shared among all instances of the ``MultiMeshInstance``.


Description
-----------

``MultiMeshInstance`` is a specialized node to instance :ref:`GeometryInstance<class_geometryinstance>`\ s based on a :ref:`MultiMesh<class_multimesh>` resource.

This is useful to optimize the rendering of a high amount of instances of a given mesh (for example tree in a forest or grass strands).
