Exporting for Android
=====================

Exporting for Android has fewer requirements than compiling Godot for it. The
following steps detail what is needed to setup the SDK and the engine.

Download the Android SDK
------------------------

Download and install the Android SDK from
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

Install OpenJDK or Oracle JDK
-----------------------------
Download and install  `OpenJDK <https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild>`__ or `Oracle JDK <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`__. Versions below JDK 8 may not work, some users have reported issues with the jarsigner (used to sign the APKs) in JDK 7.

Create a debug.keystore
-----------------------

Android needs a debug keystore file to install to devices and distribute
non-release APKs. If you have used the SDK before and have built
projects, ant or eclipse probably generated one for you (on Linux and
macOS, you can find it in the ``~/.android`` directory).

If you can't find it or need to generate one, the keytool command from
the JDK can be used for this purpose:

::

    keytool -keyalg RSA -genkeypair -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keystore debug.keystore -storepass android -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US" -validity 9999

Make sure you have adb
----------------------

Android Debug Bridge (adb) is the command line tool used to communicate with
Android devices. It's installed with the SDK, but you may need to install one
(any) of the Android API levels for it to be installed in the SDK directory.

Setting it up in Godot
----------------------

Enter the Editor Settings screen. This screens contains the editor
settings for the user account in the computer (It's independent from the
project).

Scroll down to the section where the Android settings are located:

In that screen, the path to 3 files needs to be set:

-  The *adb* executable (adb.exe on Windows)
-  The *jarsigner* executable (from JDK 6 or 8)
-  The debug *keystore*

Once that is configured, everything is ready to export to Android!
