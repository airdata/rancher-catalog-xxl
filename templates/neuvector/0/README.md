# NeuVector

### Info:

NeuVector provides continuous network security for application containers. 

Deploy the NeuVector containers to protect running containers from violations, threats, and vulnerabilities. NeuVector also detects host and container privilege escalations / break outs.

NeuVector can be deployed on greenfield or brownfield (already running) application environments.
