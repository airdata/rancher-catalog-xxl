This is achieved through creation of a Flocker Hub Stateful Application Manifest (SAM) file (aka. "manifest"), which is used side by side with the Docker Compose file. The SAM file is a YAML file that defines data volumes from ClusterHQ's Flocker Hub, synchronizes data snapshots locally, and maps them to Docker volumes in the Docker Compose file.
