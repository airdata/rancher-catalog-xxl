Configuring an IDE
==================

We assume that you already `cloned <https://github.com/airdata/godot>`_
and :ref:`compiled <toc-devel-compiling>` Godot.

Kdevelop
--------

It is a free, open source IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
for Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and other Unix flavors.

You can find a video tutorial `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNVoWQi9TJA>`_.
Or you may follow this text version tutorial.

Start by opening Kdevelop and choosing "open project".

.. image:: img/kdevelop_newproject.png

Choose the directory where you cloned Godot.

.. image:: img/kdevelop_openproject.png

For the build system, choose "custom build system".

.. image:: img/kdevelop_custombuild.png

Now that the project has been imported, open the project configuration.

.. image:: img/kdevelop_openconfig.png

Add the following includes/imports:

::

    .  // a dot to indicate the root of the Godot project
    core/
    core/os/
    core/math/
    tools/
    drivers/
    platform/x11/  // make that platform/osx/ if you're using OS X

.. image:: img/kdevelop_addincludes.png

Apply the changes then switch to the "Custom Buildsystem" tab.
Leave the build directory blank. Enable build tools and add ``scons``
as the executable and add ``platform=x11 target=debug`` (``platform=osx``
if you're on OS X).

.. image:: img/kdevelop_buildconfig.png

Next we need to tell KDevelop where to find the binary.
From the "run" menu, choose "Configure Launches".

.. image:: img/kdevelop_configlaunches.png

Click "Add new" if no launcher exists. Then add the path to your
executable in the executable section. Your executable should be located
in the ``bin/`` sub-directory and should be named something like
``godot.x11.tools.64`` (the name could be different depending on your
platform and depending on your build options).

That's it! Now you should be good to go :)

QtCreator

Importing the project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Choose *New Project* -> *Import Project* -> *Import Existing Project*.
-  Set the path to your Godot root directory and enter the project name.
-  Here you can choose which folders and files will be visible to the project. C/C++ files
   are added automatically. Potentially useful additions: \*.py for buildsystem files, \*.java for Android development,
   \*.mm for macOS. Click "Next".
-  Click *Finish*.
-  Add a line containing ``.`` to *project_name.includes* to get working code completion.

Build and run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build configuration:

-  Click on *Projects* and open the *Build* tab.
-  Delete the pre-defined ``make`` build step.
-  Click *Add Build Step* -> *Custom Process Step*.
-  Type ``scons`` in the *Command* field.
-  Fill the *Arguments* field with your compilation options. (e.g.: ``p=x11 target=debug -j 4``)

Run configuration:

-  Open the *Run* tab.
-  Point the *Executable* to your compiled Godot binary (e.g: ``%{buildDir}\bin\godot.windows.tools.64.exe``)
-  If you want to run a specific game or project, point *Working directory* to the game directory.
-  If you want to run the editor, add ``-e`` to the *Command line arguments* field.

Xcode
-----

Project Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Create an Xcode external build project anywhere

.. image:: img/xcode_1_create_external_build_project.png

- Set the *Build tool* to the path to scons

Modify Build Target's Xcode Info Tab:

- Set *Arguments* to something like: platform=osx tools=yes bits=64 target=debug
- Set *Directory* to the path to Godot's source folder. Keep it blank if project is already there.
- You may uncheck *Pass build settings in environment*

.. image:: img/xcode_2_configure_scons.png

Add a Command Line Target:

- Go to Xcode File > New > Target... and add a new Xcode command line target

.. image:: img/xcode_3_add_new_target.png

.. image:: img/xcode_4_select_command_line_target.png

- Name it something so you know not to compile with this target
- e.g. ``GodotXcodeIndex``
- Goto the newly created target's *Build Settings* tab and search for *Header Search Paths*
- Set *Header Search Paths* to an absolute path to Godot's source folder
- Make it recursive by adding two \*'s to the end of the path
- e.g. ``/Users/me/repos/godot-source/\**``

Add Godot Source to the Project:

- Drag and drop godot source into project file browser.
- Uncheck *Create External Build System*

.. image:: img/xcode_5_after_add_godot_source_to_project.png

- Click Next
- Select *create groups*

.. image:: img/xcode_6_after_add_godot_source_to_project_2.png

- Check off only your command line target in the *Add to targets* section
- Click finish. Xcode will now index the files.
- Grab a cup of coffee... Maybe make something to eat, too
- You should have jump to definition, auto completion, and full syntax highlighting when it is done.

Scheme Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edit Build Scheme of External Build Target:

- Open scheme editor of external build target
- Expand the *Build* menu
- Goto *Post Actions*
- Add a new script run action, select your project in ``Provide build settings from`` as this allows you to use ``${PROJECT_DIR}`` variable.

.. image:: img/xcode_7_setup_build_post_action.png

- Write a script that gives the binary a name that Xcode will recognize
- e.g. ``ln -f ${PROJECT_DIR}/godot/bin/godot.osx.tools.64 ${PROJECT_DIR}/godot/bin/godot``
- Build the external build target

Edit Run Scheme of External Build Target:

- Open the scheme editor again
- Click Run

.. image:: img/xcode_8_setup_run_scheme.png

- Set the *Executable* to the file you linked in your post build action script
- Check *Debug executable* if it isn't already
- You can go to *Arguments* tab and add an -e and a -path to a project to debug the editor
  not the project selection screen

Test it:

- Set a breakpoint in platform/osx/godot_main_osx.mm
- It should break at the point!
